# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project was to create an earthquake map with several overlays.
The three different overlays show the techtonic plates,
earthquakes over a magnitude of 4.5 and a dark layer.

In this project I used VSCode,Java Script, HTML and referenced Leaflet, USGS earthquake feed and
Github for information.
